So here is a fitting simulator implementation of EVE Online in JavaScript (Typescript)

# Build:
## Requirements
- Phobos
- yarn (via npm)

## Building
Make sure all dependencies are install by running ```yarn install```, get data from Phobos and copy the output to the ```src/cache``` folder. Run ```yarn run build``` in the command line, this will create a vendor.js and app.js in the dist/ folder.
